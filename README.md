Stripper What?~~  

*Lets Keep it professional here*

Carl & Ariel thank you for taking the time to walkthrough this stuff and show us the ropes. Thank you for the crash course in ssh keys. We kind of went down a rabbit hole on that one, but I figured I would ask and I am sure that Tom felt the same way.

Now that we are "Get"ing there....or should I say "Git"ing there hopefully we can dive into some more new stuff. Hopefully by next month I will have at least something on [vcaptainangrgy.com](vcaptainangrgy.com) and/or mattputhoff.com. **Stay Tuned for that!**

I will leave it open for next time cause there is a lot of stuff that I would like to dive into.

* More "Get" or I mean "Git"
* Ansible - getting dirty with it.
* Homelab stuff
* Dive into AWS or GCP some more, just to mess around.
